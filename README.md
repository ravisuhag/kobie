> A lightweight library for software architecture modelling

An kobie architecture repository comprises of interactions organised into groups. Each interaction has a markup.html and description.md file which are used to render an example of the interaction. A group can also have an description and is used for organisational purposes. You also have the option to add pages of content, for example an introduction page and/or coding guidelines specific to your project.


## Getting Started

Firstly globally install Kobie:

`npm install -g kobie`

Then from within your project root initialise kobie e.g.:

`kobie init` 

Finally add your first interaction e.g.:

`kobie new user/create`

Your architecture repository should now be up and running though granted it will look a little sparse at this stage.
